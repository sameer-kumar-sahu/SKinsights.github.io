									<p>In every organization, the workforce is its heartbeat. But understanding what keeps that heartbeat strong—or what weakens it—isn’t guesswork. It’s data work. This project was all about diving deep into HR data using pure SQL, uncovering what really drives employee satisfaction, retention, training effectiveness, and overall workforce dynamics.</p>
                                    <p>In today’s competitive landscape, retaining top talent, understanding employee sentiment, and optimizing workforce efficiency aren’t just operational tasks—they’re strategic imperatives. Businesses that fail to listen to their workforce risk not just higher attrition, but weakened productivity and eroded culture. That’s where HR analysis steps in.</p>
									<p>Today, companies don’t just want to know how many people left—they want to know why, when, and what can be done to prevent it. With this in mind, I used SQL as the lens to reveal trends, risks, and actionable patterns in employee behavior and performance.</p>
									
									<h4 class="major">But how does this fit into your business puzzle?</h4>
									<p>Companies, much like competitive teams, aim to build strong, high-performing workforces that drive long-term success. But unlike fantasy worlds, real-world growth demands data-backed decisions and a deep understanding of your people.</p>
									<p>This is exactly where I step in—with SQL-powered HR analysis that decode what’s really happening beneath the surface.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Workforce Strategist:</h4>
											<p>Just like companies want to outsmart the market, they also need to outsmart attrition. Using SQL, I help uncover which departments have the highest turnover, identify patterns in performance, and provide insights to retain top talent before it’s too late.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Employee Whisperer:</h4>
											<p>Knowing your workforce isn’t just about headcount—it’s about understanding behavior, sentiment, and growth potential. I segment employees by experience level, training participation, and survey feedback, helping HR teams design more personalized and effective strategies for engagement and retention.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Performance Tuner:</h4>
											<p>HR teams often sit on massive data lakes—from recruitment to performance reviews. But data is only useful when it tells a clear story. I use pure SQL to transform messy tables into crisp, actionable narratives that drive informed HR decisions—no guesswork, just clarity.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>										</ul>
									
									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<h2>Let's continue this journey!</h2>	
									<p></p>	
									
									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>To conduct an end-to-end analysis of HR data using structured SQL queries, covering core HR functions: attrition, training, performance, recruitment channels, promotions, and employee satisfaction. The goal was to convert raw datasets into business insights that can inform people strategy and HR decision-making.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Chapter 1: Data Structuring & Transformation</h3>
									<p>Before insights, comes order. I cleaned and structured the data using SQL: handling missing values, creating relational tables, and organizing datasets into employee, recruitment, training, and survey-based categories. This structured foundation enabled precise query writing and complex joins across datasets.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Chapter 2: SQL-Powered Analytics</h3>
									<p>I wrote SQL queries—categorized as Basic to Advance, extract insights such as:</p>
                                    
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Attrition Analysis</h4>
											<ul>
											<li>Identified departments and job roles with the highest attrition rates</li>
											<li>Linked promotion delays of leaving</li>
											<li>Explored attrition over years of service</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Performance Trends</h4>
											<ul>
											<li>Mapped training hours to performance ratings</li>
											<li>Evaluated high-performing departments</li>
											<li>Analyzed impact of previous promotions on current performance</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Recruitment Source Effectiveness</h4>
											<ul>
											<li>Tracked which hiring channels brought in the best talent</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Employee Satisfaction Insights</h4>
											<ul>
											<li>Correlated survey scores with attrition and promotions</li>
											<li>Analyzed satisfaction by department, gender, and seniority level</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Hiring source efficiency (internal vs. external recruitment)</h4>
											<p>I used techniques like JOINS, CTEs, subqueries, GROUP BY, HAVING, and CASE statements to answer real business questions.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h3 class="major">Key Insights</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Attrition Hotspots:</h4>
											<p>Sales and HR departments had the highest attrition, with over 60% of exited employees coming from these two functions—especially those with no promotions in the past 3 years.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Training Works:</h4>
											<p>Employees who completed more than 20 hours of training annually achieved, on average, 15% higher performance scores than those with less training exposure.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Promotion Delay = Exit Risk:</h4>
											<p>Employees who had not been promoted in the last 36 months showed a 2x higher chance of attrition compared to those recently promoted.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Satisfaction Drives Retention:</h4>
											<p>Employees with satisfaction scores of 4.0 or above had attrition rates below 12%, while those with scores below 3.0 had rates exceeding 30%.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Hiring Source Matters:</h4>
											<p>Referral hires demonstrated the highest retention rate (88%) and were 60% more likely to be promoted within 2 years, compared to hires from external job portals.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Departmental Health:</h4>
											<p>R&D and Operations departments had the strongest workforce health, with the lowest turnover (<10%), highest average satisfaction (4.2+), and above-average performance ratings.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Engagement Score Patterns:</h4>
											<p>Employees with rolling engagement scores above 4.0 maintained longer tenure and higher performance consistency, showing a clear link between engagement and productivity.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
								
                                    
									<h3 class="major">Final Thoughts </h3>
										<p>This SQL-only project reflects how structured queries and relational data can power critical decisions in HR. By analyzing behavior, trends, and gaps across the employee lifecycle, I provided insights that could help businesses retain talent, boost satisfaction, and optimize internal mobility—all without needing dashboards or fancy tools.</p>
										<p>Just clean queries. Clear answers.</p>
